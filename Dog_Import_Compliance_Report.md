## Executive Summary

This report summarises the **Swiss-entry legal requirements** and the **practical travel risks** for importing a young puppy from Spain to Switzerland on **January 28, 2026**.

**Border-entry status (Switzerland):** ✅ **Likely compliant** *if and only if* you travel with the exact documents required by the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO/BLV), including the **signed declaration for young animals**.

**Operational status (airport/airline/Spain-side):** ⚠️ **Medium risk** because:
- The commonly cited “15 weeks minimum” rule (12 weeks + 21 days) is the default EU rabies validity rule, and
- Airlines and check-in agents often enforce conservative interpretations.

**Key point:** Switzerland’s FSVO/BLV guidance explicitly describes a pathway for **12–16 week** animals to enter **within 21 days after rabies vaccination**, but that does **not** guarantee your airline (or a Spanish export/check-in gatekeeper) will accept it without additional confirmation.

## 2. Regulatory Framework

### 2.1 Swiss Import Requirements (Entry into Switzerland from the EU)

Switzerland’s rules for travelling with pet dogs, cats and ferrets are published by the **Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO/BLV)**.

#### Standard Requirements:
- Dogs must be microchipped for identification
- Rabies vaccination required for dogs ≥12 weeks old
- Standard waiting period: **21 days** post-vaccination before entry
- Valid EU Pet Passport required

#### Special Provision for Young Dogs (12-16 Weeks):

The FSVO/BLV explicitly states (emphasis added):

> **“Animals aged between 12 and 16 weeks old must be vaccinated against rabies. If entry takes place within 21 days after vaccination, the keeper must provide a written declaration confirming that the animals have never come into contact with wild animals of species susceptible to rabies.”**

**Official Source (Switzerland):**  
- FSVO/BLV: Dogs, cats and ferrets (entry from the EU): `https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/en/home/tiere/reisen-mit-heimtieren/hunde-katzen-und-frettchen.html`

---

### 2.2 EU Baseline Rule (Why “15 weeks minimum” is often quoted)

EU law sets the baseline that a *primary* rabies vaccination becomes valid only after protective immunity is established:

> **“the period of validity of the vaccination starts from the establishment of protective immunity, which shall not be less than 21 days … for the primary vaccination”**

**Official Source (EUR-Lex, Regulation (EU) No 576/2013):**  
`https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R0576`

Practical implication: if the first rabies shot can only be given at ~12 weeks, then **12 weeks + 21 days ≈ 15 weeks**.

### 2.3 “Young Animals” Exception (EU concept; Switzerland explicitly applies it for EU entry)

The EU Commission explains that the “young animals” exception (covering **<12 weeks unvaccinated**, and **12–16 weeks vaccinated but not yet valid**) is **optional** (“discretion”) for destination jurisdictions:

> **“EU countries have discretion whether or not they allow the introduction onto their territory of ‘young dogs, cats and ferrets’ … less than 12 weeks old … or between 12 and 16 weeks old … but are not yet fully protected …”**

**Official Source (EU Commission):**  
`https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/movement-pets/eu-legislation/young-animals_en`

Switzerland’s FSVO/BLV page (Section 2.1) is evidence that Switzerland **does** allow the exception for entry from the EU (subject to the declaration).

### 2.4 Spanish Ministry Text (User-provided excerpt; source URL not provided)

You provided a Spanish-language excerpt stating that for travel from EU / low-rabies-risk countries the **minimum age is 15 weeks**, based on:
- first vaccination at **≥12 weeks**, then
- waiting **≥21 days** for immunity.

This is consistent with the **EU baseline rule** in Section 2.2.

**Important limitation:** Because no source URL or document reference was provided for that excerpt, this report treats it as **informational** and does **not** cite it as an official source. If you provide the original link/PDF, it can be included as a primary citation.

## 3. Compliance Analysis

### 3.1 Age Requirement
- ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Dog will be 14 weeks old (within 12-16 week window)

### 3.2 Vaccination Timeline
- ✅ **COMPLIANT** - Vaccination scheduled for January 13, 2026 (dog will be 12+ weeks)
- ✅ **COMPLIANT (Swiss entry rule)** - Travel on January 28, 2026 (15 days post-vaccination, within special provision window), **provided the declaration is carried**

### 3.3 Documentation
- ✅ **Required:** Microchip implantation (must be done before rabies vaccination)
- ✅ **Required:** EU Pet Passport with vaccination records
- ✅ **Required:** Written owner declaration (see Section 4.3)
- ✅ **Required (if traveller is not the owner):** Written authorisation (power of attorney) for the accompanying family member (see Section 4.4)

---

## 4. Required Documentation

### 4.1 EU Pet Passport
Must contain:
- Animal identification (microchip number)
- Owner details
- Veterinary validation of rabies vaccination
- Date of vaccination: January 13, 2026
- Vaccine batch number and veterinarian signature

### 4.2 Microchip
- Must comply with ISO 11784/11785 standards
- Must be implanted **before** rabies vaccination
- Number must be recorded in pet passport

### 4.3 Owner Declaration

For young animals, Switzerland requires the **signed declaration of non-contact with rabies-susceptible wild animals**. The EU has a standard declaration format and wording; FSVO/BLV links to it.

The declaration template linked by FSVO/BLV includes wording that the signer is either:
- the **owner**, or
- a **natural person who has authorisation in writing from the owner** to carry out the non-commercial movement.

**Official declaration template (PDF):**  
`https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/import-export/import/eu-erklaerung-welpen-db.pdf.download.pdf/EU_Erkl%C3%A4rungBesitzer_Welpen_EN.pdf`

**Practical instruction:** Print and complete that PDF using the puppy’s:
- microchip number
- EU pet passport number
- place/date/signature

### 4.4 Written Authorisation for the Family Member (Recommended / Practically Necessary)
Because the FSVO/BLV-linked declaration template explicitly references an **authorised person**, you should prepare a short written authorisation letter that states the family member is authorised to:
- travel with the puppy,
- sign/hold the required declaration on your behalf, and
- present documents to airline staff and border/customs officials.

Keep it with photocopies of your passport/ID and the purchase/ownership documentation dated **December 21, 2025**.

## 5. Airline Requirements (SWISS) — Evidence Gap

### 5.1 What we can and cannot cite
In this research environment, `swiss.com` is **not accessible** (requests are blocked), so this report **does not** include any SWISS-specific rules as authoritative requirements.

### 5.2 What you must do anyway (non-controversial)
- Register/confirm pet transport with SWISS well in advance.
- Bring **destination-entry documents** (Swiss FSVO/BLV requirements) to check-in.
- Expect conservative enforcement at check-in; have the FSVO/BLV page and the completed declaration printed.

---

## 6. Import Procedure

### 6.1 Pre-Departure (Spain)
1. ✅ Ensure microchip is implanted (before January 13)
2. ✅ Administer rabies vaccination (January 13, 2026)
3. ✅ Complete EU Pet Passport
4. ✅ Prepare and sign the FSVO/BLV-linked declaration template (Section 4.3)
5. ✅ Prepare written authorisation for the family member (Section 4.4)

## 7. Risk Assessment (Legal vs Practical)

### 7.1 Regulatory Compliance Risk
**Swiss entry law risk:** ✅ **Low** *if documents are correct*.

Swiss FSVO/BLV guidance explicitly allows entry for 12–16 week animals within 21 days after vaccination if accompanied by the written declaration.

### 7.2 Practical/Operational Risk (Spain-side + Airline)
**Risk Level:** ⚠️ **Medium**

Reason: some authorities and check-in desks rely on the default rule “12 weeks + 21 days = 15 weeks minimum”.

The EU Commission explains that EU countries have **discretion** on whether they allow the “young animals” exception:

> **“EU countries have discretion whether or not they allow the introduction onto their territory of ‘young dogs, cats and ferrets’ … less than 12 weeks old … or between 12 and 16 weeks old … but are not yet fully protected …”**

| Potential Issue | Mitigation |
|----------------|------------|
| Missing documentation | Use the checklist in Section 9; print everything and carry originals + copies |
| Microchip not readable | Ask vet to scan microchip and record verification before travel |
| Declaration rejected | Use the FSVO/BLV-linked declaration template PDF (Section 4.3), not a home-made statement |
| Airline denies boarding | Get written confirmation from SWISS customer service that the FSVO/BLV exception + declaration is acceptable for the booked flight |
| Spain-side “15 weeks minimum” guidance blocks you | Ask your vet/competent authority in Spain what they will accept for export to Switzerland, and show the Swiss FSVO/BLV rule |
| Customs/VAT delay | Carry receipt/contract for the dog; Switzerland charges VAT on purchases abroad (BAZG) |

## 10. Conclusion

**Swiss entry:** Based on Swiss FSVO/BLV guidance, importing your 12–16 week puppy on **January 28, 2026** (15 days after rabies vaccination) is **likely permissible** **if** you carry the correct documentation, including the **signed declaration of no contact with rabies-susceptible wild animals**.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. ✅ Dog age falls within the 12–16 week provision
2. ✅ Microchip is implanted **before** the rabies vaccination and correctly recorded
3. ✅ You use the **FSVO/BLV-linked** declaration template (not an informal statement)
4. ✅ The family member carries written authorisation + copies of your ID
5. ⚠️ You secure **airline acceptance** (SWISS) in writing

**Recommendation:** You can plan around January 28, but do not treat it as “guaranteed” until SWISS (and any Spain-side veterinary/export gatekeeper) explicitly accepts the Swiss FSVO/BLV exception for your itinerary.
